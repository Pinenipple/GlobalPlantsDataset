## Week 2 Progress

### Literature Review
- **Created and uploaded** a Literature Review that explores *multi-country* research on energy consumption, emissions, and economic trends.
- Emphasized how **policy instruments** (e.g., carbon pricing, renewable incentives) shape national-level energy outcomes across various countries.
- Highlighted **key methodologies** such as panel data approaches, co-integration, and difference-in-differences for policy impact evaluation.

### Data Alignment
- **Refined dataset selection** to integrate:
  1. IEA time-series data  
  2. World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI)  
  3. The Global Power Plant Database
- **Outlined steps** to incorporate both *quantitative* (e.g., subsidy levels) and *qualitative* (e.g., policy start dates) information into the analysis.

Stay tuned for **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and initial **modeling** phases, building on insights from the literature review.
